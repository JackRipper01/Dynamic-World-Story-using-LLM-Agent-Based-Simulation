The storm outside, a tempest of wind and rain, mirrored the disquiet that had settled within the walls of Blackwood Manor. It was a night of secrets and shadows, a night when the venerable Lord Alistair Finch had been found dead in his study, the circumstances shrouded in a fog of suspicion. Now, gathered in the opulent, yet somehow stifling, drawing-room, were the remaining players in this macabre drama: Inspector Thomas Dubois, a man whose unassuming demeanor belied a mind as sharp as a honed blade; Eleanor Finch, the estranged niece, her eyes wide with a mixture of grief and fear; Dr. Aris Thorne, the family physician, whose calm facade seemed to barely contain a hidden knowledge; Madame Xenia Petrova, the flamboyant art dealer, her presence as dramatic as the storm raging outside; and Mr. Davies, the unflappable butler, an enigma of quiet observation.

The air in the drawing-room was thick with unspoken accusations and the faint, unsettling scent of oil. The Inspector, a man who preferred facts to speculation, rose from his armchair and moved towards the fireplace, his gaze fixed on the wet footprints marring the polished floor. He knelt, examining them with meticulous care, his movements precise and economical.

"Be careful, Mr. Dubois," Mr. Davies's voice, flat and devoid of emotion, broke the tense silence. "The Study is the scene of a… unfortunate incident. Try not to disturb anything further."

Madame Petrova, ever the opportunist, seized the moment. Rising from her armchair, she smoothed her silk skirt and glided towards the Inspector. "Such a tragedy, to lose Lord Alistair… and in such a place," she murmured, placing a delicate hand on Dubois's arm. "The family collection… I trust the authorities will exercise the utmost care in their investigation. There are some truly *priceless* pieces within these walls, you see." Her eyes, however, betrayed a specific, almost predatory, interest in something beyond the general collection.

Dr. Thorne, his face an impassive mask, added his own measured words. "Indeed, a great loss, Lord Alistair. And, as Madame Petrova rightly points out, a profound impact on the future of the family's… legacy. I trust the authorities will proceed with… discretion. One must be mindful of delicate sensibilities at a time like this." He glanced at Eleanor, his expression a complex mixture of concern and something else, something that Dubois, with his keen eye for detail, could not quite decipher.

Eleanor, her composure clearly fragile, turned to Mr. Davies. "Mr. Davies, do you... do you know what happened in the Study? Is it... is it connected to... to Lord Alistair's... passing?"

"Is... is anyone else aware of the... the smell of oil? It's rather strong, isn't it?" she added, her voice trembling slightly.

Mr. Davies, his gaze steady and unwavering, replied to Eleanor, "Indeed, Miss Finch. The oil, you noticed it. It appears a container may have been… compromised. Best not to linger in its vicinity."

Dubois, sensing an opening, turned to Eleanor. "Miss Finch," he said, his voice low and measured, "The oil. You've noticed it. And the… unfortunate incident in the Study. Tell me, were you, or anyone else, in the Study earlier this evening, perhaps near the time of Lord Alistair's... passing?"

Dr. Thorne, ever the pragmatist, said "Indeed, Miss Finch, the smell is quite… noticeable. And concerning. Perhaps, we should all remain in the drawing room, at least until the source of this… *compromise* is fully understood."

Eleanor, her nervousness evident, replied, "Mr. Dubois, I... I was not in the Study earlier this evening. I was... with Lord Alistair, in the library, discussing... financial matters. We parted ways shortly before dinner."

Dubois turned to Mr. Davies, his voice unwavering. "Mr. Davies, you mentioned that the situation in the Study was an 'unfortunate incident'. Can you elaborate? What precisely happened in there before... before Lord Alistair was found?"

Madame Petrova, her eyes gleaming with a predatory light, interjected, "Miss Finch," she said, her voice laced with a touch of sympathetic curiosity, "You mentioned being with Lord Alistair in the library. Did you happen to notice anything… unusual, before you parted ways? Any indication that… something was amiss? Or any… specific items that may have captured your attention?" Her gaze, for a fleeting moment, swept over Eleanor, assessing, judging.

Mr. Davies, the very picture of unflappable composure, fixed Dubois with a steady gaze. "The precise details, Mr. Dubois, are best left to the authorities. Suffice to say, Lord Alistair was discovered in the Study. The circumstances… are currently under investigation."

Eleanor, her voice tight with tension, answered Madame Petrova. "No, Madame Petrova, nothing... nothing unusual. We were merely discussing… estate matters. And I did not notice any specific items of interest. My mind was preoccupied with… other things."

Dubois, undeterred, turned his attention back to Eleanor. "Miss Finch," he said, his voice calm but firm, "You were with Lord Alistair shortly before his death, in the library, you say. And you noticed nothing… amiss. However, the oil, and the circumstances in the Study, are… concerning. Could you perhaps describe, in detail, the nature of your discussion with Lord Alistair? Specifically, what *estate matters* were you discussing?"

Mr. Davies, ever the voice of propriety, stated, "Mr. Dubois, I believe it's best if we all await the Inspector's arrival. He is the one who will determine what questions are relevant."

Dr. Thorne, his tone carefully modulated, said "The storm outside is a tempest, indeed, And the questions… they too, swirl about us like the wind. Perhaps, for now, we should all focus on comforting ourselves and finding some semblance of… *calm*."

Madame Petrova, her eyes glittering, said, "Mr. Dubois, such thorough questioning is, of course, expected. But perhaps, before we delve too deeply into Miss Finch's affairs, we might consider the *more immediate* implications of… the oil? It seems a rather significant detail, wouldn't you agree? Might it be connected to the… incident in the Study? Perhaps, Mr. Davies, you could enlighten us? Is there anything... valuable that might..."

"Madame Petrova, the source of the oil is, as yet, undetermined," Mr. Davies replied. "It appears to be a… mechanical issue. As for its connection to Lord Alistair's… demise, that, too, is under investigation. I am not at liberty to speculate."

Eleanor, her anxiety palpable, turned to Mr. Davies. "Mr. Davies, has the… source of the oil been identified? And, more importantly… is there any danger? Is it… flammable?"

"Flammable," Madame Petrova murmured, her voice low and carrying just enough to be overheard, "That would be… *unfortunate*. Such a dreadful thing, a fire. Destroys everything. And, of course, it would be a terrible shame if any of the… more *irreplaceable* pieces were to be… damaged."

Dr. Thorne, seeing Eleanor's distress, offered, "Miss Finch, perhaps the smell of oil is causing some… uneasiness. If you are feeling unwell, I would be more than happy to… examine you. It would be a shame if any of us were to succumb to the stresses of the day. Such a thing might complicate… matters further."

Dubois, his gaze fixed on Mr. Davies, stated, "Mr. Davies, you seem particularly concerned about the authorities' investigation. Is there something specific you believe they might overlook? Perhaps something… hidden?"

Madame Petrova, her voice now laced with a hint of impatience, said, "Mr. Dubois, I find your line of questioning… *fascinating*. And perhaps, a little… *premature*. Before we concern ourselves with the mysteries of the oil, wouldn't you agree that we should first establish the identity of those who were *closest* to Lord Alistair in his final hours? Those, for example, who were involved in… *financial discussions*?"

Dr. Thorne, ever the voice of reason, added, "Mr. Dubois, While Madame Petrova's suggestion is… prudent, I believe we should remain focused on the immediate concerns. Your interest in Miss Finch's affairs, while perhaps well-intentioned, feels a touch… precipitous. Before we cast stones, perhaps we should consider the *practical* implications of this oil. Mr. Davies, could you confirm if there are any flammable materials stored near the Study door? A fire, as Madame Petrova so aptly..."

Dubois, his eyes narrowed, turned to Madame Petrova. "Madame Petrova, While I agree that establishing Lord Alistair's immediate associates is crucial, I believe we are remiss if we ignore the tangible evidence before us. The oil, the circumstances in the Study, and the… *compromised* state of whatever container it originated from. These are the physical clues, the tangible starting points. If we dismiss them too readily, we risk overlooking..."

Mr. Davies remained steadfast. "Mr. Dubois, as I have stated, the investigation is best left to the authorities. I am not at liberty to discuss the specifics of the situation in
