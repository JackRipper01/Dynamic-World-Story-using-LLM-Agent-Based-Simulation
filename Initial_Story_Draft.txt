The humid night air clung to the city, thick and suffocating like a shroud. Rain threatened, mirroring the storm brewing inside Josh. He stared at the looming facade of the museum, its granite face slick with the promise of a downpour. Inside, bathed in the cold glow of security lights, lay his salvation: a diamond necklace, the price of his daughter Sarah’s life-saving operation. Beside him, Albert stood, a silhouette against the neon glow of a nearby bar, a cigarette’s ember the only visible sign of his presence. Albert, the man who held the keys to his hopes, and perhaps, his downfall.

"Albert... are you sure about this? I mean, the security... they said it was state-of-the-art. And... what if we get caught? Sarah..." Josh’s voice was a shaky whisper, the words catching in his throat. He pictured Sarah’s face, pale and fragile in her hospital bed, and the fear clenched his gut.

Albert turned, the cigarette a fiery punctuation mark in the darkness. His face, when briefly illuminated by the match, was a study in cool calculation. "Relax, Josh. State-of-the-art security? Please. That's what they *want* you to think. Now, let's go. The sooner we're in and out, the sooner you can go back to your... Sarah." The words, though meant to reassure, felt like a dismissive shove.

"Right. Right," Josh stammered, trying to project a confidence he didn’t feel. His heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the silence. "Let's... let's just be quick about this, alright? The less time we spend here, the better."

"Don't worry, Josh. I've handled worse. Now, are you going to stand there gawking, or are you going to *help* me get rich?" Albert’s voice was laced with impatience, the edge of a threat. He was a shark, circling, ready to strike.

"Just... promise me we stick to the plan, Albert. No improvising, alright? I can't afford any mistakes." The words felt inadequate, a flimsy shield against the coming storm.

Albert scoffed. "Stick to the plan? Josh, *I am* the plan. Now, let's move. And try to keep up." He was already moving, his long strides eating up the distance towards the museum’s imposing entrance.

"Wait... before we go. What about cameras? Did you disable them all?" Josh’s voice cracked, the fear finally breaking through.

Albert stopped, a flicker of annoyance crossing his face. "Cameras? Of *course*, I disabled the cameras. Do you think I'm some kind of amateur? Now, are you ready, or do I have to do everything myself?"

"Alright... alright, let's go." Josh felt a leaden weight settle in his stomach. He took a deep breath, trying to steel himself. He was committed now, and the only way out was through.

Albert pushed the bathroom door open, a casual gesture that belied the tension in the air. He strode into the main hallway, a predator entering its hunting ground. The air inside was cold, sterile, smelling faintly of antiseptic and old varnish.

Josh hesitated, the door ajar. He peeked out, his eyes darting left and right, scanning the long, empty hallway for any sign of movement. The polished marble floor reflected the dim light, creating an illusion of endless space. His breath hitched in his throat.

Albert, already at the first display case, expertly inserted a pick into the lock. The metallic click echoed in the silence, a tiny sound that felt amplified in the cavernous space.

Josh slowly stepped out of the bathroom, his back pressed against the wall, and immediately ducked his head to the left, peering cautiously around the corner. Every shadow seemed to hold a threat.

"Relax, Josh. We're in. Just try to keep up, and maybe you'll get a piece of the pie." Albert, oblivious to Josh's terror, was already focused on the prize.

Josh ignored him, his eyes fixed on the display cases, quickly searching for the Jewel Exhibit. He silently gestured with his head towards it, a silent plea for them to stick to the plan.

Albert, ignoring Josh, opened the display case, his movements precise and practiced. He removed a golden chalice, turning it over in his hands, assessing its value. "Don't get distracted, Josh. I'll handle the good stuff. You can start scouting the other exhibits."

Josh, his legs heavy with dread, took a hesitant step towards the Jewel Exhibit. He could almost feel the weight of the necklace, the promise it held, the price it demanded.

Albert, now in the Security Room, after checking for threats, had left Josh. He turned and slowly walked towards the Security Room.

Josh took a few steps further, his eyes fixed on the display case. His voice was a mere whisper to himself, "This is it. Just this. Then we go."

Albert, now in the Security Room, cycled through the camera feeds, his fingers flying across the control panel. He found the Jewel Exhibit feed and disabled it, the screen flickering and then going dark.

Josh, in the hallway, took a step back. He was alone, the weight of the situation crushing him. He whispered to himself, the words lost in the vastness of the hall, then turned and walked towards the Main Hallway.

Albert, in the Security Room, swiveled in the chair, leaned back, and studied the security monitor, focusing on feeds other than the Jewel Exhibit, attempting to discern patrol times.

Josh, in the Main Hallway, took a few hesitant steps towards Albert, his hands clasped tightly in front of him. He tried to meet his gaze, but his eyes kept darting away. He swallowed hard, and his voice was barely a whisper as he said, "Albert... please. Let's just go. We can... we can try something else. This is... it's too much."

Albert, in the Security Room, leaned forward, tapped a button on the control panel, and the security monitor displayed the feed from the Main Hallway near the Jewel Exhibit.

Josh, turning and walking away, ran towards the Bathroom, his head down.

Albert, in the Security Room, held the code breaker near the keypad, the device whirring, and the door clicked, unlocking.

Josh, in the Main Hallway, turned and ran towards the door to the Main Hallway, then burst out of the Bathroom.

Albert, in the Security Room, leaned in and pressed the "Alarm Override" button on the control panel.

Josh, in the Main Hallway, turned and ran towards the Bathroom.

Albert, in the Security Room, activated the code breaker, watching its screen intently.

Josh, in the Bathroom, entered the bathroom, shutting and bolting the door behind him.

Albert, in the Security Room, leaned forward, eyes glued to the security monitor and door lock panel, ready to remotely lock the door if needed.

Josh, in the Bathroom, carefully pushed the loose tiles back into place, concealing the tunnel entrance.

Albert, in the Security Room, typed the code into the keypad and the door remained unlocked, allowing him to pass through.

Josh, in the Bathroom, splashed cold water on his face, momentarily clearing his head.

Albert, in the Security Room, quickly input the code and prepared to unlock the door.

Josh, in the Bathroom, leaned against a sink, stared at his reflection, murmured to himself, and took a few deep breaths.

Albert, in the Security Room, as the door clicked open, slammed his palm on the "Door Lock" button, securing the door from the inside.

Josh, in the Bathroom, took a step towards one of the toilets, lifted the lid, and peered inside.

Albert, in the Security Room, "Let's see how long it takes him to realize he's on his own now." A cruel smile played on his lips.

Josh, in the Bathroom, closed the toilet lid and took a few steps away from the sinks, then began inspecting the door frame.

Albert, in the Security Room, leaned forward, eyes fixed on the security monitor, subtly checking the timer and smiling.

Josh, in the Bathroom, leaned against the cold tiled wall, reached out, and ran his trembling hand along the door frame, carefully examining it for any weaknesses.

Albert, in the Security Room, leaned forward, zoomed in on the Jewel Exhibit entrance on the security monitor, and smiled.

Josh, in the Bathroom, reached out and pressed the "ON" button on one of the hand dryers, which began to whir.

Albert, in the Security Room, "Tick-tock, Josh. Time's almost up."

Josh, in the Main Hallway, slowly backed away from the door, keeping his eyes on it, and began to meticulously check the grout lines of the tiled walls, running his fingers along each line.

Albert, in the Security Room, "Alright, let's see if my 'partner' has the brains to get out before the timer hits zero. Or if I need to 'adjust' the security measures further."

Josh, in the Main Hallway, carefully scans the floor, his eyes darting from side to side
