The tempest outside mirrored the turmoil within Blackwood Manor. Rain lashed against the leaded windows, each gust of wind a mournful sigh that echoed through the cavernous halls. Inside, the flickering firelight danced across the faces of the assembled guests, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with unspoken secrets. Inspector Thomas Dubois, a man whose unassuming exterior belied a keen, analytical mind, surveyed the scene. Lord Alistair Finch, the manor's master, was dead, found in his study under circumstances shrouded in a thick veil of mystery. The air itself hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood and the cloying, acrid scent of linseed oil, a smell that clung to the back of the throat and seemed to deepen the already pervasive sense of unease.

The drawing room, usually a haven of convivial conversation, was now a stage for suspicion and veiled accusations. Eleanor Finch, the estranged niece and newly declared sole beneficiary of the deceased Lord Alistair's will, wrung her hands, her face a mask of barely contained hysteria. Dr. Aris Thorne, the family physician, his gaze flitting between Eleanor and the others with a practiced concern, exuded a practiced calm. Madame Xenia Petrova, a flamboyant art dealer whose presence hinted at clandestine dealings, moved with a predatory grace, her eyes missing nothing. And then there was Mr. Davies, the stoic butler, an embodiment of quiet authority, whose every clipped word and measured gesture seemed to hold a hidden significance.

The Inspector, his gaze drawn to the damp footprints marring the polished floor near the fireplace, broke the tense silence. He knelt, his movements precise and deliberate, examining the imprints. A ripple of unease seemed to pass through the assembled company. "Be careful, Mr. Dubois," Mr. Davies had warned, his voice a low rumble. "The Study is the scene of a… unfortunate incident. Try not to disturb anything further."

Xenia Petrova, seizing the opportunity to inject herself into the investigation, glided towards the Inspector. "Such a tragedy, to lose Lord Alistair… and in such a place," she purred, her voice a silken caress. "The family collection… I trust the authorities will exercise the utmost care in their investigation. There are some truly *priceless* pieces within these walls, you see."

Dr. Thorne nodded in agreement, his voice smooth as velvet. "Indeed, a great loss, Lord Alistair. And, as Madame Petrova rightly points out, a profound impact on the future of the family's… legacy. I trust the authorities will proceed with… discretion. One must be mindful of delicate sensibilities at a time like this."

"Is... is anyone else aware of the... the smell of oil? It's rather strong, isn't it?" Eleanor Finch's voice, thin and reedy, broke through the tension.

"Indeed, Miss Finch," Mr. Davies replied, his gaze fixed on the young woman. "The oil, you noticed it. It appears a container may have been… compromised. Best not to linger in its vicinity."

Dubois, his eyes now narrowed, turned towards Eleanor. "Miss Finch," he said, his voice low and measured, "The oil. You've noticed it. And the… unfortunate incident in the Study. Tell me, were you, or anyone else, in the Study earlier this evening, perhaps near the time of Lord Alistair's... passing?"

Dr. Thorne immediately intervened. "Indeed, Miss Finch, the smell is quite… noticeable. And concerning. Perhaps, we should all remain in the drawing room, at least until the source of this… *compromise* is fully understood."

Eleanor, her voice trembling, denied any involvement. "Mr. Dubois, I... I was not in the Study earlier this evening. I was... with Lord Alistair, in the library, discussing... financial matters. We parted ways shortly before dinner."

Dubois turned back to Mr. Davies. "Mr. Davies," he stated, his voice level, "You mentioned that the situation in the Study was an 'unfortunate incident'. Can you elaborate? What precisely happened in there before... before Lord Alistair was found?"

Xenia Petrova, her eyes glinting with a predatory curiosity, turned to Eleanor. "Miss Finch," she said, her voice laced with a touch of sympathetic curiosity, "You mentioned being with Lord Alistair in the library. Did you happen to notice anything… unusual, before you parted ways? Any indication that… something was amiss? Or any… specific items that may have captured your attention?"

Mr. Davies remained the picture of unflappable composure. "The precise details, Mr. Dubois, are best left to the authorities. Suffice to say, Lord Alistair was discovered in the Study. The circumstances… are currently under investigation. I will answer further questions when the Inspector arrives."

Eleanor, her voice tight, shook her head. "No, Madame Petrova, Nothing... nothing unusual. We were merely discussing… estate matters. And I did not notice any specific items of interest. My mind was preoccupied with… other things."

Dubois, his gaze unwavering, focused on Eleanor once more. "Miss Finch," he said, his voice calm but firm, "You were with Lord Alistair shortly before his death, in the library, you say. And you noticed nothing… amiss. However, the oil, and the circumstances in the Study, are… concerning. Could you perhaps describe, in detail, the nature of your discussion with Lord Alistair? Specifically, what *estate matters* were you discussing?"

Mr. Davies, ever the sentinel, interjected. "Mr. Dubois, I believe it's best if we all await the Inspector's arrival. He is the one who will determine what questions are relevant."

Dr. Thorne, with a touch of the dramatic, added, "The storm outside is a tempest, indeed, And the questions… they too, swirl about us like the wind. Perhaps, for now, we should all focus on comforting ourselves and finding some semblance of… *calm*."

"The oil… is a rather significant detail, wouldn't you agree?" Xenia Petrova interjected, her gaze flitting from one person to the next. "Might it be connected to the… incident in the Study? Perhaps, Mr. Davies, you could enlighten us? Is there anything... valuable that might..."

"Madame Petrova, the source of the oil is, as yet, undetermined," Mr. Davies replied, his voice devoid of emotion. "It appears to be a… mechanical issue. As for its connection to Lord Alistair's… demise, that, too, is under investigation. I am not at liberty to speculate."

"Flammable," Xenia Petrova murmured, her voice low and carrying just enough to be overheard, "That would be… *unfortunate*. Such a dreadful thing, a fire. Destroys everything. And, of course, it would be a terrible shame if any of the… more *irreplaceable* pieces were to be… damaged."

"Miss Finch, perhaps the smell of oil is causing some… uneasiness," Dr. Thorne offered with a practiced concern. "If you are feeling unwell, I would be more than happy to… examine you. It would be a shame if any of us were to succumb to the stresses of the day. Such a thing might complicate… matters further."

Dubois, his gaze unwavering, turned to Mr. Davies. "Mr. Davies," he stated, "You seem particularly concerned about the authorities' investigation. Is there something specific you believe they might overlook? Perhaps something… hidden?"

Xenia Petrova, her eyes sparkling with a mixture of excitement and calculation, interjected, "Mr. Dubois, I find your line of questioning… *fascinating*. And perhaps, a little… *premature*. Before we concern ourselves with the mysteries of the oil, wouldn't you agree that we should first establish the identity of those who were *closest* to Lord Alistair in his final hours? Those, for example, who were involved in… *financial discussions*?"

"Mr. Dubois," Dr. Thorne countered, his voice calm but with a subtle undercurrent of steel, "While Madame Petrova's suggestion is… prudent, I believe we should remain focused on the immediate concerns. Your interest in Miss Finch's affairs, while perhaps well-intentioned, feels a touch… precipitous. Before we cast stones, perhaps we should consider the *practical* implications of this oil. Mr. Davies, could you confirm if there are any flammable materials stored near the Study door? A fire, as Madame Petrova so aptly..."

"Madame Petrova," Dubois said, his voice measured, "While I agree that establishing Lord Alistair's immediate associates is crucial, I believe we are remiss if we ignore the tangible evidence before us. The oil, the circumstances in the Study, and the… *compromised* state of whatever container it originated from. These are the physical clues, the tangible starting points. If we dismiss them too readily, we risk overlooking..."

"Mr. Dubois, as I have stated, the investigation is best left to the authorities," Mr. Davies stated, his voice firm. "I am not at liberty to discuss the specifics of the situation in the Study, or the state of the container, whatever it may have been. Your persistence is... unproductive."
