The storm outside mirrored the turmoil within Blackwood Manor. Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows, mirroring the tempest of accusations and veiled threats swirling within the grand drawing room. Inspector Thomas Dubois, a man whose unassuming demeanor belied a mind as sharp as a honed blade, surveyed the assembled company. The air hung thick with unspoken anxieties and the cloying scent of oil, a detail that had already piqued his keen interest.

Eleanor Finch, the estranged niece of the deceased Lord Alistair, wrung her hands, her face a mask of distress. Dr. Aris Thorne, the late Lord's physician, exuded a deceptive calm, his eyes darting between the others with unnerving precision. Madame Xenia Petrova, the flamboyant art dealer, surveyed the room with an air of detached observation, her gaze lingering on a specific painting on the far wall. And then there was Mr. Davies, the stoic butler, an island of impassivity amidst the rising tide of suspicion. His silence was as telling as the words spoken, and Dubois knew the key to unlocking the truth lay hidden within his carefully guarded secrets.

The first ripple of unease had begun with Dr. Thorne's pronouncement about the storm echoing the internal turmoil. Then Dubois, ever the pragmatist, had knelt, his gaze fixed on the wet footprints marring the polished floor near the fireplace. "Be careful, Mr. Dubois," Davies had cautioned, his voice a low rumble. "The Study is the scene of an… unfortunate incident." The phrase hung in the air, pregnant with unspoken meaning. Madame Petrova, sensing an opportunity, had glided towards Dubois, her silken skirt whispering against the floor. "Such a tragedy," she had murmured, her voice laced with carefully crafted concern. "To lose Lord Alistair… and in such a place. There are some truly *priceless* pieces within these walls, you see."

The room had been a pressure cooker of veiled accusations and thinly-veiled secrets. Thorne had echoed Petrova's sentiments about the delicate sensibilities. Then, Eleanor had spoken the words that would set the stage for the rest of the evening's dark drama. "Is... is anyone else aware of the... the smell of oil? It's rather strong, isn't it?" Davies had confirmed her observation with a curt: "Indeed, Miss Finch. The oil, you noticed it. It appears a container may have been… compromised. Best not to linger in its vicinity." Dubois, seizing the opening, had turned to Eleanor, his voice low and measured. "Miss Finch, the oil. You've noticed it. And the… unfortunate incident in the Study. Tell me, were you, or anyone else, in the Study earlier this evening, perhaps near the time of Lord Alistair's... passing?"

As the evening progressed, the tension had only mounted. Xenia Petrova's pronouncements about the value of the family collection, Aris Thorne's subtle warnings, and Davies's stonewalling had only served to deepen the mystery. Eleanor's claim of being with Lord Alistair in the library, discussing estate matters, felt like a carefully constructed facade. Dubois, however, was not easily deterred. He pressed, probing, and questioning, his gaze unwavering. The storm continued its relentless assault on the manor, a fitting backdrop to the unfolding drama. Dubois knew that the truth, like the storm outside, was bound to break, and when it did, it would sweep away the carefully constructed lies and reveal the killer, and their method, in all its chilling clarity.
