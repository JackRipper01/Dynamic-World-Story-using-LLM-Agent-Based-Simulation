The humid night air hung heavy over the city, the neon glow of the distant skyline a stark contrast to the oppressive darkness that cloaked the museum. Inside, Albert, a man whose sharp features were etched with a perpetual air of impatience, adjusted the lockpicks in his calloused hand. Beside him, Josh, his face pale in the dim light cast by the bathroom’s single bulb, wrung his hands, his eyes darting nervously between Albert and the reinforced steel door. They were mere moments from the heist, the culmination of weeks of meticulous planning and a desperate gamble that could either save Josh's daughter or bury them both.

"Albert... are you sure?" Josh finally stammered, his voice barely above a whisper. "The security... they said it was state-of-the-art. And… what if we get caught? Sarah..."

Albert scoffed, his lips curling into a sneer. "Relax, Josh. State-of-the-art? Please. That's what *they* want you to think. Now, let's go. The sooner we're in and out, the sooner you can get back to your... Sarah." He punctuated his words with a dismissive wave of his hand, the glint of the lockpicks catching the light.

Josh swallowed hard, the fear evident in his eyes. "Right. Right," he mumbled, trying to project an air of confidence that he clearly didn't feel. "Let's… let's hurry, okay? The less time we spend here, the better."

Albert slammed the bathroom door open and strode out into the hallway, his movements fluid and confident. Josh hesitated, his gaze sweeping the hall, a silent plea for reassurance. He followed Albert, his back plastered against the wall, his senses on high alert. He was a shadow, trailing in Albert's wake, and the weight of his daughter's life pressed heavily on his shoulders.

"Don't worry, Josh. I've been through worse," Albert said, his voice a low rumble as he knelt before the display case. "Now, are you going to stand there gaping, or are you going to *help* me get rich?" He inserted a slim pick into the lock of the display case, the delicate click echoing in the otherwise silent hall.

"Just… promise me we'll stick to the plan, Albert," Josh pleaded, his voice cracking slightly. "No improvising, okay? I can't afford any mistakes."

"Stick to the plan? Josh, *I am* the plan. Now, move it. And try to keep up." Albert's fingers danced over the lock, the tumblers yielding with practiced ease.

"Wait… before we go," Josh said, his voice barely audible above the pounding of his own heart. "What about the cameras? Did you disable them all?"

"Cameras? Of course, I disabled the cameras. Do you think I'm an amateur? Are you ready, or do I have to do everything myself?" Albert’s voice was laced with thinly veiled impatience.

"Right… right, let's go." Josh's voice was flat, devoid of any conviction.

Albert pushed the bathroom door open, stepping into the main corridor. The air felt thick with anticipation, the silence punctuated only by the faint hum of the building's systems. He moved with a purpose, his eyes scanning the hallway, already envisioning the loot.

Josh, lagging behind, slowly opened the bathroom door, his gaze darting cautiously down the hall, searching for any sign of danger. He kept close to the wall, his body tense, every sense amplified. He was a rabbit in a den of wolves.

Albert’s fingers worked with practiced ease, the lock of the display case surrendering to his skill. He ignored Josh, his focus solely on the prize. "Easy, Josh," Albert said, without turning. "We're in. Try and keep up, and maybe you'll get a piece of the pie."

Ignoring Albert's words, Josh's gaze was immediately drawn to the display of jewels, his eyes locking onto the diamond necklace.

Albert, oblivious to Josh's internal struggle, opened the display case, his hand reaching for a golden chalice. He examined it for a moment, his expression one of cold appraisal. "Don't get distracted, Josh. I'll handle the good stuff. You can start exploring the other displays."

Josh, his resolve crumbling, took a hesitant step toward the jewels. The weight of his daughter's medical bills, the desperate need for a miracle, warred with the growing unease in his gut.

Albert, now in the security room, reviewed the camera feeds, his eyes narrowed as he scanned the images. He found the feed from the jewellery display and began to study it.

"This is it. Just this. Then we leave." Josh whispered to himself, his gaze still fixed on the shimmering diamonds.

Albert tried to speak to Josh, but the distance between them rendered his words useless.

Josh’s hands were tightly clasped in front of him as he took a step back, whispering to himself, then turned and walked towards the main corridor.

Albert, his eyes scanning the monitors, leaned back in his chair, searching for a weakness, a blind spot.

Josh tried to speak to Albert, but the distance between them rendered his words useless.

"Albert... please. Let's go. We can... we can try something different. This is... too much." Josh’s voice was barely a whisper, his eyes darting around the empty hallway, searching for an escape, a way out of this nightmare.

Albert leaned forward, his gaze fixed on the monitor, and pressed a button on the control panel. The monitor shifted, displaying a live feed from the main corridor, near the jewellery display. He saw Josh, his back to him, his posture conveying a mix of fear and regret.

Josh, his resolve breaking, turned and walked quickly back toward the bathroom. The plan, meticulously crafted, was unraveling.

Albert, his fingers flying over the keypad, activated the code-breaker. This was the moment of decision, the point of no return. His future, and his freedom, lay in the balance.

Josh inspected the bathroom, wondering where Albert could be. The air in the small space felt heavy, the silence amplifying his mounting anxiety.

Albert, his eyes scanning the camera feeds, had lost sight of Josh. He was lost in his own perfect plan.

Josh heard a noise, a subtle click, and slammed the bathroom door shut, bolting it from the inside. Fear, cold and sharp, pierced through him.

Albert, now impatient, scanned the monitors, his gaze sweeping the building.

Josh knelt, his hand reaching for a small box. He picked up a knife. His hand was shaking.

Albert leaned forward, his gaze fixed on the monitor. He keyed in the code to the lock, the door remained unlocked.

Josh leaned against the door, the knife clutched tightly in his hand. He waited, his heart hammering against his ribs, praying the sound he heard was Albert. "Albert... Albert, is that you…?"

Albert, his patience wearing thin, began to search the cameras for any sign of Josh.

Josh, his resolve crumbling, took a deep breath, the cool water offering a moment of clarity.

Albert, impatient, began to search the cameras.

Josh, his mind racing, began to consider the tunnel's entrance, a potential escape route.

Albert, his gaze locked on the timer, smiled.

Josh, leaning against the cold tiled wall, made a decision. He had to find Albert.

Albert's voice echoed in the silence of the security room. "Let's see how long it takes him to realise he's on his own."

"Tick-tock, Josh. Time's running out."

Josh, his eyes scanning the hallway, began to move forward.

Albert adjusted the monitor's feed, watched as Josh moved towards the jewellery display.

Josh examined the area carefully, murmuring. "Damn it" when he realized Albert wasn't there.

Albert pressed a button, activating the security lockdown on the jewellery display.

"Come on, Josh. Don't disappoint me. You have five minutes, or I'm leaving you behind. And the treasure."
