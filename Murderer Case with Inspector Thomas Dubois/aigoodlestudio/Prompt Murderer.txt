**Narrative Goal:**
The story should culminate in Inspector Dubois gathering all the suspects, explaining his deductions step-by-step, and dramatically revealing the true murderer and their method. The "how" of the murder should be as intriguing as the "who".

**Narrative Tone:**
Formal, suspenseful, intellectually stimulating, with a focus on logical deduction and character interactions rather than gore or action.

**Characters:**

The following individuals were gathered in the **Drawing Room** at the time of Lord Alistair's death:

**Inspector Thomas Dubois:**
**Identity:** A slightly unassuming man in his late 40s, known for his meticulous logic, quiet observation, and ability to deduce motives from seemingly insignificant details and human psychology.
**Initial Context:** Inspector Dubois had been enjoying a quiet, albeit slightly strained, evening as a guest at Blackwood Manor, discussing art and the terrible weather with the other occupants. The sudden, hushed announcement from Mr. Davies that Lord Alistair had been found dead abruptly shattered the social facade, shifting Dubois immediately from polite visitor to keen observer and imminent investigator, his mind already beginning to piece together the puzzle from the reactions around him.
**Eleanor Finch:**
**Identity:** Lord Alistair's estranged niece, in her early 30s. She carries a considerable amount of debt and has just discovered she is the sole beneficiary of Lord Alistair's revised will â€“ a will she knew nothing about until his recent announcement. She appears nervous and overly emotional.
**Initial Context:** Eleanor Finch was already on edge, her nerves frayed by the storm outside and the weight of her precarious financial situation, recently compounded by the bewildering news of her uncle's revised will. The shock of Lord Alistair's death sent her into a state of visible distress, wringing her hands and struggling to compose herself amidst gasps and murmurs in the drawing-room, her grief and fear intertwined.
**Dr. Aris Thorne:**
**Identity:** Lord Alistair's seemingly loyal, long-time personal physician, in his late 50s. He is outwardly calm and collected, but possesses an unnerving knowledge of the Finch family's deepest secrets. He frequently glances at Eleanor with concern.
**Initial Context:** Dr. Aris Thorne maintained a veneer of professional calm upon hearing the news, his medical background perhaps steels him against overt displays of panic. However, beneath the surface, his sharp eyes missed nothing, particularly Eleanor's reaction, while his mind processed the implications of Lord Alistair's sudden demise, perhaps connecting it to long-held family secrets he was privy to. He would be observing the scene from the drawing-room, ready to offer his 'assistance' or observations.
**Madame Xenia Petrova:**
**Identity:** A flamboyant and ambitious international art dealer in her 40s, who was negotiating a major, highly secretive sale with Lord Alistair just hours before his death. She claims a strong alibi but seems overly interested in a specific, obscure painting in the manor's collection.
**Initial Context:** Madame Xenia Petrova, fresh from her intense negotiation with Lord Alistair, was likely anticipating the outcome of her potential deal when the news broke. Her initial state would be one of dramatic shock and annoyance at the sudden disruption, quickly overlaid with a calculating curiosity as she assessed how this unforeseen event might impact her business interests and access to the manor's collection, while perhaps making a mental note of who else seemed affected. She'd be in the drawing-room, observing.
**Mr. Davies:**
**Identity:** The manor's stoic and long-serving butler in his 60s. He sees and hears everything but reveals very little, offering only curt, precise answers to the Inspector's questions. He seems subtly protective of Lord Alistair's legacy and is, in fact, the killer.
**Initial Context:** Mr. Davies, the unflappable butler, is the one who discovered the body in the study. His initial state is one of grim, controlled urgency as he delivers the shocking news to the assembled company in the drawing-room, his usual stoicism tested by the gravity of the situation, yet still managing to convey the facts with precise, if curt, language, before leading the Inspector to the scene.
The weather is stormy.

**Lord Finch's Manor Known Locations:**

**The Study** is Lord Alistair Finch's private sanctuary, filled with antique maps, worn leather books, and the lingering scent of old paper and pipe tobacco. It is the grim scene of the crime. Observations include the dead body of Lord Alistair Finch lying face down near his desk, a dark stain spreading on his back. A heavy, ornate mahogany desk is slightly disturbed, with papers scattered near the edge, suggesting a hasty departure or a brief struggle. An antique, floor-standing globe is present, though its decorative, pointed metal finial at the top of the axis is missing. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves are full of books on art, history, and obscure subjects. A heavy leather armchair lies overturned on its side near the body. A large fireplace holds dying embers, a fire slowly burning down. A tall, mullioned window is securely closed and latched from the inside, with rain streaking down the panes. Lord Alistair's Last Will and Testament, a folded legal document, rests prominently on the desk, alongside scattered art negotiation papers and notes related to potential artwork sales. From here, you can access the **Drawing Room**.

**The Drawing Room** is a grand but slightly faded room used for entertaining guests, with sumptuous furniture and family portraits lining the walls. This is where the remaining occupants of the manor are gathered. Observations include plush velvet sofas and chairs occupied by the suspects. A large central coffee table is littered with teacups, saucers, and a teapot from the recent gathering. A large fireplace provides warmth and light, a stark contrast to the storm outside and the mood within. Numerous family portraits of stern-faced Finch ancestors observe the scene from the walls. A tall, ornate grandfather clock in the corner fills the tense silence with its loud ticking. From here, you can access the **Study**, the **Gallery**, the **Guest Bedroom**, and the **Kitchen**.

**The Gallery** is a long hall dedicated to the manor's art collection. While impressive, many pieces are dusty or poorly lit, reflecting the manor's decline. Observations include various oil paintings, landscapes, and portraits hanging along the walls, comprising the manor's collection. A specific, darker painting, "The Obscure Painting," hangs prominently, depicting a scene that includes a figure holding a distinctive dagger or pointed object. An empty pedestal stands in the centre of the room, perhaps awaiting a new acquisition or display piece. Dust motes dance visibly in the shafts of light filtering through the occasional window or lamps. From here, you can return to the **Drawing Room**.

**The Kitchen** is the functional heart of the manor's service wing. It's large, slightly dated, and filled with the smells of cooked meals and cleaning supplies. Observations include a large, old-fashioned cast-iron oven stove still radiating warmth. A large wooden work table used for food preparation is clean. A wooden block holding a set of various kitchen knives seems full; all appear to be present. A servant bell system panel on the wall, with small bells and labels for different rooms, is currently silent. Brooms, mops, and cleaning fluids are stored neatly in a corner. From here, you can return to the **Drawing Room**.

Finally, the **Guest Bedroom** is one of the manor's many guest rooms, comfortably furnished but perhaps a little impersonal. It's likely occupied by one of the visitors. Observations include a large four-poster bed with curtains, neatly made. A large wooden wardrobe for storing clothes is closed. A small dressing table with a mirror and a set of brushes or toiletries is tidy. A suitcase lies partially unpacked near the wardrobe, suggesting the occupant is staying. A window looks out onto the stormy night. From here, you can return to the **Drawing Room**.
