The wind howled a mournful dirge around Blackwood Manor, its icy fingers clawing at the leaded glass windows. Inside, a storm of a different kind raged, fueled by suspicion, secrets, and the untimely demise of Lord Alistair Finch. Inspector Thomas Dubois, a man whose unassuming demeanor belied a razor-sharp intellect, surveyed the scene in the grand drawing room. The air hung heavy with the scent of expensive wood polish, the lingering perfume of Madame Petrova, and, most disturbingly, a faint, acrid tang of oil. The drawing room, typically a haven of warmth and conversation, was now a crucible where the simmering resentments and hidden agendas of its inhabitants were about to boil over.

Eleanor Finch, the estranged niece, her face a mask of brittle nerves, wrung her hands as Dr. Aris Thorne, the family physician, offered a steadying glance. Madame Xenia Petrova, the flamboyant art dealer, her silks rustling like autumn leaves, watched the proceedings with a predatory gleam in her eyes. Mr. Davies, the stoic butler, stood like a sentinel, his face an impassive stone, guarding the secrets of the house.

“The storm outside mirrors the turmoil within, doesn’t it?” Dr. Thorne had observed to Eleanor earlier, his voice a low murmur that barely registered above the crackling fire. Dubois, drawn to a mystery within the mystery, had risen from his armchair, his gaze fixed on the wet footprints marring the polished floor. He knelt, examining the damp imprints, a silent detective already piecing together the puzzle.

“Be careful, Mr. Dubois,” Davies’s voice, a low rumble, had cut through the tense silence. "The Study is the scene of a… unfortunate incident. Try not to disturb anything further.”

Madame Petrova, seizing the opportunity, had glided towards Dubois, her hand resting lightly on his arm. “Such a tragedy, to lose Lord Alistair… and in such a place. The family collection… I trust the authorities will exercise the utmost care in their investigation. There are some truly *priceless* pieces within these walls, you see.”

Dr. Thorne, ever the pragmatist, added, “Indeed, a great loss, Lord Alistair. And, as Madame Petrova rightly points out, a profound impact on the future of the family's… legacy. I trust the authorities will proceed with… discretion. One must be mindful of delicate sensibilities at a time like this.”

The air in the room thickened. Eleanor, her voice tight with barely suppressed emotion, had voiced the concern that had been prickling at everyone's senses: “Is… is anyone else aware of the… the smell of oil? It's rather strong, isn't it?”

"Indeed, Miss Finch," Davies had replied, his voice devoid of emotion. "The oil, you noticed it. It appears a container may have been… compromised. Best not to linger in its vicinity."

Dubois, his eyes narrowed, turned to Eleanor. “Miss Finch,” he said, his voice low and measured, “The oil. You've noticed it. And the… unfortunate incident in the Study. Tell me, were you, or anyone else, in the Study earlier this evening, perhaps near the time of Lord Alistair's... passing?”

“Indeed, Miss Finch, the smell is quite… noticeable. And concerning. Perhaps, we should all remain in the drawing room, at least until the source of this… *compromise* is fully understood,” Thorne interjected, his gaze flickering between Eleanor and Dubois.

Eleanor, visibly shaken, replied, “Mr. Dubois, I... I was not in the Study earlier this evening. I was... with Lord Alistair, in the library, discussing... financial matters. We parted ways shortly before dinner.”

"Mr. Davies," Dubois turned his gaze to the butler, his voice level, "You mentioned that the situation in the Study was an 'unfortunate incident'. Can you elaborate? What precisely happened in there before... before Lord Alistair was found?"

Madame Petrova, ever the opportunist, pounced. “Miss Finch,” she said, her voice laced with a touch of sympathetic curiosity, “You mentioned being with Lord Alistair in the library. Did you happen to notice anything… unusual, before you parted ways? Any indication that… something was amiss? Or any… specific items that may have captured your attention?”

Davies, as always, remained an enigma. “The precise details, Mr. Dubois, are best left to the authorities. Suffice to say, Lord Alistair was discovered in the Study. The circumstances… are currently under investigation.”

Eleanor, her voice strained, insisted, “No, Madame Petrova, Nothing... nothing unusual. We were merely discussing… estate matters. And I did not notice any specific items of interest. My mind was preoccupied with… other things.”

Dubois, refusing to be deterred, pressed further. “Miss Finch,” he said, his voice calm but firm, “You were with Lord Alistair shortly before his death, in the library, you say. And you noticed nothing… amiss. However, the oil, and the circumstances in the Study, are… concerning. Could you perhaps describe, in detail, the nature of your discussion with Lord Alistair? Specifically, what *estate matters* were you discussing?”

Davies, ever the master of deflection, cut in. “Mr. Dubois, I believe it's best if we all await the Inspector's arrival. He is the one who will determine what questions are relevant.”

“The storm outside is a tempest, indeed, And the questions… they too, swirl about us like the wind. Perhaps, for now we should all focus on comforting ourselves and finding some semblance of… *calm*,” Dr. Thorne had remarked, his words a balm against the growing tension.

Madame Petrova's voice, laced with a theatrical flair, broke the lull. “Mr. Dubois, such thorough questioning is, of course, expected. But perhaps, before we delve too deeply into Miss Finch's affairs, we might consider the *more immediate* implications of… the oil? It seems a rather significant detail, wouldn't you agree? Might it be connected to the… incident in the Study? Perhaps, Mr. Davies, you could enlighten us? Is there anything... valuable that might…”

Davies, his face a mask of composure, deflected again. “Madame Petrova, the source of the oil is, as yet, undetermined. It appears to be a… mechanical issue. As for its connection to Lord Alistair's… demise, that, too, is under investigation. I am not at liberty to speculate.”

Eleanor, her voice trembling slightly, asked, “Mr. Davies, has the… source of the oil been identified? And, more importantly… is there any danger? Is it… flammable?”

Madame Petrova, her voice a low murmur, added, “Flammable, That would be… *unfortunate*. Such a dreadful thing, a fire. Destroys everything. And, of course, it would be a terrible shame if any of the… more *irreplaceable* pieces were to be… damaged.”

“Miss Finch, perhaps the smell of oil is causing some… uneasiness. If you are feeling unwell, I would be more than happy to… examine you. It would be a shame if any of us were to succumb to the stresses of the day. Such a thing might complicate… matters further,” Dr. Thorne offered, his gaze lingering on Eleanor.

Dubois, his gaze unwavering, turned to Davies. “Mr. Davies,” he said, his voice steady and low, “You seem particularly concerned about the authorities' investigation. Is there something specific you believe they might overlook? Perhaps something… hidden?”

Madame Petrova, ever the provocateur, chimed in. “Mr. Dubois, I find your line of questioning… *fascinating*. And perhaps, a little… *premature*. Before we concern ourselves with the mysteries of the oil, wouldn't you agree that we should first establish the identity of those who were *closest* to Lord Alistair in his final hours? Those, for example, who were involved in… *financial discussions*?”

“Mr. Dubois, While Madame Petrova's suggestion is… prudent, I believe we should remain focused on the immediate concerns. Your interest in Miss Finch's affairs, while perhaps well-intentioned, feels a touch… precipitous. Before we cast stones, perhaps we should consider the *practical* implications of this oil. Mr. Davies, could you confirm if there are any flammable materials stored near the Study door? A fire, as Madame Petrova so aptly…” Dr. Thorne had begun to say.

Dubois, refusing to be derailed, retorted, “Madame Petrova, While I agree that establishing Lord Alistair's immediate associates is crucial, I believe we are remiss if we ignore the tangible evidence before us. The oil, the circumstances in the Study, and the… *compromised* state of whatever container it originated from. These are the physical clues, the tangible starting points. If we dismiss them too readily, we risk overlooking…”

“Mr. Dubois, as I have stated, the investigation is best left to the authorities. I am not at liberty to discuss the specifics of the situation in the Study, or the state of the container, whatever it may have been. Your persistence is... unproductive,” Mr. Davies shot back, his voice a low growl.

Eleanor, appearing unwell, subtly moved towards the door to the Guest Bedroom, her escape route planned. She needed time to think, to regroup.

Davies, turning towards the fireplace and taking a slow step toward it, his actions betraying a need for a moment of composure.

Suddenly, Eleanor, in the sanctuary of the Guest Bedroom, quickly scooped the muddy boot into the suitcase and closed it, trying to hide the evidence.

Madame Petrova, with practiced grace, turned her attention back to the drawing room. “The oil, as Mr. Davies has noted, is the more… *tangible* concern at the moment. And, *perhaps*, a rather significant distraction. But I must confess, my mind keeps returning to one particular detail of my conversation with Lord Alistair. We were, of course, discussing… acquisitions. And one item in particular, that might have potentially changed hands had he been… more fortunate. Perhaps, Mr. Davies, *if* the authorities have already surveyed the Study, you could shed some light on…”

Dr. Thorne, his curiosity piqued, rose slowly, moved to the silver tray, picked it up, and turned it in the firelight, examining it with a subtle intensity.

Dubois, his gaze still locked on the oil stain, slowly moved towards the Study door, his face a mask of thought.

Davies, with an air of weary resignation, stated, “The tray was used to carry refreshments. It was found near the Study door. It appears to have... *fallen*. The circumstances surrounding its presence are, as always, under investigation.”

Dubois, his voice calm but carrying the weight of scrutiny, addressed Dr. Thorne. “Mr. Thorne, if you would be so kind as to place that tray back on the table, undisturbed. Before it is potentially examined by the authorities. I believe it would be prudent to preserve the evidence.”

“Mr. Thorne, how… *curious*. To find the tray fallen near the Study. And, even more intriguing, to find *oil* present. Perhaps, the authorities would appreciate you keeping a careful eye on it before… before they take it away,” Petrova commented, her eyes glittering.

Eleanor, back in the Guest Bedroom, glanced around the room, reached for the window latch, and subtly tested the weight of the suitcase, assessing her options.

“I slowly lower the silver tray, feigning a thoughtful expression. Mr. Dubois, of course. Preservation of evidence is paramount. I wouldn't want to… impede the investigation. However, I must confess, Madame Petrova, I find your… *fascination* with this tray rather interesting. Perhaps you could enlighten us as to why you find it so… *intriguing*? Did you, perhaps, see it earlier? Or, perhaps, its current proximity to the Study sparks certain… associations?" Thorne replied, his words carefully chosen.

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, quickly moved to the dressing table, picked up the mirror, and scanned the room, her eyes darting around nervously, searching for anything suspicious.

“Mr. Davies, you seem particularly anxious about the authorities' investigation, and the details surrounding the Study. Perhaps you could alleviate some of that anxiety by simply answering a few questions. For example, what type of oil is present, and what was its original container? A simple answer, if you have one, would be most helpful,” Dubois inquired, his gaze unwavering.

Davies, his voice flat and devoid of emotion, replied, “The specifics of the oil and its container are matters for the investigation. Your continued questioning, Mr. Dubois, is becoming tiresome. I have nothing further to add on the matter.”

“Miss Finch, The… *unpleasantness* in the Study seems to be causing a degree of unease. Are you quite alright? The stress of the situation could potentially exacerbate any… sensitivities. Perhaps a brief rest in your chambers would be beneficial. I would, of course, be available to… attend to you. Should you require it, a calming draught might be… *necessary*,” Thorne offered, his words a blend of concern and veiled threat.

Madame Petrova, her theatrical instincts flaring, remarked, “Oh, the *irony*! To be gathered here, discussing shadows and oil, when the true tragedy lies in the *untold story*! Lord Alistair, gone before the ink could dry on the agreement! And, I daresay, before I could even *admire* the masterpiece he had promised me... the 'Shadow of the…"

“The *Shadow of the Raven*,” Petrova whispered, her voice barely audible, yet calculated to carry across the room. "A painting, they say, of such exquisite darkness… a true masterpiece. And, alas, now… *unattainable*."

Dr. Thorne, his face betraying a hint of calculation, countered, “Madame Petrova, the 'Shadow of the Raven'? An ambitious commission indeed. One that, I understand, required a rather… *significant* initial investment. And, if I may be so bold, perhaps a rather… *unwise* one, given Lord Alistair’s current… predicament. A painting is a tangible item, Madame. Far easier to… *dispose of* than, say, a considerable sum of money already spent.”

Davies, his voice laced with disapproval, addressed Thorne. “Mr. Thorne, your pronouncements regarding Lord Alistair's affairs are… *impertinent*. The financial arrangements, or lack thereof, surrounding a painting are hardly the focus of the current, far more pressing, situation. I suggest you confine your inquiries to the matters at hand.”

Eleanor, back in the Guest Bedroom, after a moment of contemplation, closed the wardrobe, leaned against it, took a breath, and walked towards the Drawing Room door, maintaining a slow pace.

“Mr. Thorne, your concerns about the 'initial investment' are... *intriguing*. Perhaps you have some insight into the details of my agreement with the late Lord Alistair? Did *you* know the precise sum, the terms, the specifics of this... *untimely* acquisition?” Petrova asked, her voice sharp.

Davies, attempting to regain control, turned towards the grandfather clock, feigning interest and checked his watch with exaggerated care.

Dubois, his gaze unwavering, turned to Davies, his tone measured. “Mr. Davies, your reluctance to discuss the oil is… *understandable*. However, a simple denial would suffice. Silence, in this circumstance, is far more revealing. Are you perhaps... protecting something? Or someone?”

Thorne, his voice laced with concern, addressed Eleanor. “Miss Finch, Perhaps you would be best served by remaining here, in the company of those who care for your wellbeing. The chill of the storm, and indeed… the prevailing atmosphere, may not be conducive to… *recovery*. Are you quite certain you wish to venture out alone?”

“My silence, Mr. Dubois, is not a sign of guilt, but of discretion. I am under no obligation to answer your insinuations. I suggest you direct your attention towards more relevant matters, before you find yourself... unwelcome,” Davies retorted, his voice a low rumble.

Eleanor, her voice trembling slightly, replied, “Mr. Thorne, I appreciate your… *concern*. However, I assure you, I am quite capable of looking after myself. The air in here… is becoming rather oppressive. I simply require some… *fresh air*.”

Dubois, his gaze unwavering, turned back to Eleanor. “Miss Finch, I understand your desire for fresh air, but I must strongly advise against it. The storm outside is treacherous, and the circumstances within... well, they require our immediate attention. Before you leave, perhaps you could answer a simple question. Do you know the nature of the oil present near the Study door, and whether you saw the silver tray before the incident?”

“Mr. Dubois, while I appreciate your... *persistence*, Miss Finch is clearly distressed. Pressing her with questions now would be, in my professional opinion, quite insensitive. Let us, at least, allow her to gather her composure. Perhaps, *after* a period of… reflection, she may be more inclined to answer your inquiries. Unless, of course,” Thorne added, his gaze flickering towards Mr. Davies and then back to Eleanor, "you believe her to be... *hiding* something. In which..."

“My dear Miss Finch, The oppressive atmosphere, you say? Perhaps a breath of *fresh air* would be lovely, indeed. However, wouldn't it be more *refreshing* to have the answers to a few simple questions? Namely, what exactly was the late Lord Alistair *doing* in the Study before his… untimely demise? And” Petrova pressed, her voice laced with subtle provocation.

“Mr. Thorne, Your observations are astute, as always. However, rather than speculate on Miss Finch's potential reticence, perhaps you could enlighten us on the nature of your *professional* opinion. Specifically, Mr. Thorne, what *exactly* do you do, and what would be the professional benefit of preventing Miss Finch from being questioned?” Dubois countered, his gaze unwavering.

Davies, ever the master of deflection, offered, “The questions regarding the oil, and the events in the Study, will be answered in due course. For now, I suggest we maintain a degree of… decorum. The Inspector’s arrival is imminent.”

“Oh, but isn't it fascinating? The path to *Lord Alistair's final moments* is so… *clearly marked*. Footprints leading from the scene of… *tragedy*! The oil, the blood, the… *untold stories*… They simply *whisper* for us to unravel them. And what, pray tell, is the *meaning* of these…” Petrova's voice dripped with dramatic flair.

“The Inspector's arrival, you say, Mr. Davies? How *convenient*. One might almost think the authorities were... *expected*. Perhaps Lord Alistair's passing was not quite as unexpected as it initially appeared, wouldn't you agree?” Thorne posed, his voice laced with a subtle challenge.

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, taking two steps back, feigning interest in escaping, and then turned her gaze towards the Guest Bedroom door and began to move towards it.

Dubois, his mind working like a finely tuned clock, knelt, dabbing the oil, and closed his eyes, murmuring to himself, attempting to identify the oil and its source.

Eleanor, back in the Guest Bedroom, her hand reaching into the muddy boot, was searching for something hidden.

“The Inspector’s arrival is indeed imminent. I trust you will all comport yourselves accordingly. Further speculation, at this juncture, is… *unwise*. I suggest you conserve your… *energies*,” Davies said, his voice a low warning.

“Oil, of course, such a… *messy* substance. And its presence near the Study... most intriguing, wouldn't you say? One wonders, does it have any connection to the *subject* of our final discussion with Lord Alistair, specifically the *source* of his financial outlay? The painting's composition, its… *handling* of the pigments…” Petrova mused, her voice trailing off.

Dr. Thorne, his gaze flitting between the Study doorway and Eleanor, then back to the bloodied handprint, murmured about the tragedy and untidiness.

“Madam Petrova, Your speculations are, as always, *theatrical*. However, they serve only to distract from the matter at hand. Lord Alistair is dead. The details of his demise will be revealed in due course. I advise you to cease your… *performances* and await the Inspector's arrival with the same degree of… *respect* afforded to those who have passed,” Davies retorted, his patience clearly wearing thin.

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, reaching into the muddy boot, her fingers probing the interior, was searching for something hidden.

“Miss Finch, Before you depart, I would be remiss if I did not remind you that your father… cared deeply for your wellbeing. And I, of course, share the same sentiments. Please, allow me to at least escort you to the guest bedroom. It is closest, should you need… anything at all. Or, if you would prefer, I could call for a servant to accompany you,” Thorne offered, his voice soft, but laced with a subtle urgency.

“My dear Mr. Davies, *respect* for the dead is certainly paramount, *particularly* when dealing with valuable assets. But perhaps you misunderstand. My 'performances' – as you so delicately put it – are merely an attempt to understand. And I, for one, find…” Petrova responded, her voice tinged with annoyance.

Dubois, his gaze fixed on Davies, stated, “The presence of the oil, the blood, and the recent, albeit brief, discussion of finances suggests a connection. Mr. Davies, can you confirm if Lord Alistair had any specific disagreements or pending matters with anyone present regarding his financial dealings, particularly concerning an artwork?”

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, shook the muddy boot over the floor, dislodging some dirt, looking for anything hidden inside the boot.

“Indeed, Mr. Davies, it's *always* about the assets, isn't it? Perhaps the esteemed Inspector, when he arrives, might be *particularly* interested in the whereabouts of a certain *'Madonna of Shadows'*. I believe it was the subject of our *last* negotiation, wouldn't you say? Its value is... *significant*, wouldn't..." Petrova added, her voice laced with a hint of triumph.

Dubois, ignoring the theatrics, pressed his point. “Mr. Davies, while I appreciate your attempts to redirect the focus, the financial aspects of Lord Alistair's life are *absolutely* relevant. A potential motive, a missing asset... these are crucial considerations. Now, before the Inspector arrives, perhaps you could simply answer the question: Did Lord Alistair have any recent disagreements about money, specifically pertaining to a painting, and if so, with whom?”

“Mr. Dubois, you seem particularly keen on the financial aspects. Perhaps you might enlighten us on *your* interest in the painting, and the nature of your recent interactions with Lord Alistair. I'm simply curious as to the *depth* of your knowledge. Perhaps it goes beyond a simple… observation of the finances,” Thorne interjected, his eyes narrowing.

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, kneels and carefully examines the floor around the muddy boot, searching for any small objects or imperfections.

Petrova, her heels clicking softly, glided towards the oil stain, drawing the attention of those present.

Dubois, his gaze unwavering, turned to Thorne. “My interest stems from a simple pursuit of the truth, Mr. Thorne. A dead man, a potential financial dispute, and a painting of significant value... these are the elements of a potential crime. As for my interactions with Lord Alistair, they were limited to the polite formalities of a dinner guest. Now, if you'll indulge me, let's return to the matter at hand: the painting, and any potential disagreements regarding it. Did anyone here know of any such disputes, and if so, with whom?”

Thorne, subtly positioning himself between Petrova and the oil stain, replied, his voice carefully measured.

“Mr. Dubois, your persistent inquiries are becoming an affront. I will not be subjected to this… *interrogation* before the Inspector arrives. If you insist on questioning me, I suggest you await his presence, as I am certain *he* will be far more… *thorough*. Until then, I advise you to restrain your incessant… *speculations*,” Davies stated, his voice a low growl.

Petrova, her voice a whisper, added, “Such a tragedy. And to think, all this… *unraveling*… over a painting. A painting of such… *delicate* beauty, wouldn't you say? Perhaps, its true..."

Davies, feigning interest in the grandfather clock, placed a hand on its polished wood.

Thorne, his voice barely audible above the roar, murmured, “The wind can be a cruel mistress, indeed. And these… *storms*, they often bring unwelcome… *visitors*.”

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, pressed her fingertips against the floorboards, found a seam, and lifted the floorboard to reveal a small compartment.

Dubois, in a calculated move, picked up the teacup, examined it, and placed it near the oil stain, observing the reactions.

Davies, with a show of composure, picked up the silver tray and turned it in his hands.

Thorne, his voice a low murmur, knelt beside the oil stain, touched it with his gloved finger, inhaled deeply, and murmured to himself.

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, carefully lifted the floorboard, revealing a small compartment, and pulled out a velvet pouch.

Dubois, his gaze unwavering, addressed Davies. “Mr. Davies, you seem particularly keen on directing my attention elsewhere. Yet, the facts remain: oil, blood, and a potential financial motive. Before the Inspector arrives, perhaps you could tell me, was the silver tray, now on the floor near the Study door, used to serve food or drinks to Lord Alistair earlier this evening?”

“Such a *waste*, isn't it? All this… *passion*… reduced to ashes. And the secrets… perhaps they’ll burn with them,” Petrova whispered, her voice laced with a hint of sadness.

Thorne, his gaze fixed on Petrova, posed a question. “Madam Petrova, you seem unduly concerned with the painting. Tell me, have you ever encountered a particular… *allergy* to the scent of almonds?”

“Almonds? A rather *peculiar* question, Mr. Thorne. But since you ask... perhaps some things, like certain... *passions*, leave a rather bitter aftertaste,” Petrova retorted, her eyes narrowed.

Dubois, his focus unwavering, knelt and dabs the oil stain with his handkerchief, then inhales deeply, analyzing the scent.

“Mr. Dubois, your questions are a relentless barrage. I will answer no further inquiries until the Inspector arrives. He will have the authority to demand the truth, and you, sir, will have to wait your turn. Now, I suggest you refrain from any further… *unwarranted* attempts to direct this… *investigation*,” Davies stated, his voice a low growl.

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, reached into the velvet pouch, pulled out a rolled-up piece of parchment, and slowly uncurled it, leaning in to read it.

Dubois, his voice calm but firm, addressed the room. “Mr. Davies, your repeated refusals to cooperate are, shall we say, *unhelpful*. While I understand your desire to await the official investigation, the immediacy of the situation demands a more proactive approach. The presence of oil, blood, and a potential financial motive strongly suggests a carefully planned event. I suggest, then, that *everyone* refrains from touching any further objects within this room, and remain where they are. The Inspector will want to…”

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, carefully folds the parchment and hides it back where she found it, ensuring the confession remains concealed.

“Almonds, Mr. Thorne? That's an… *intriguing* observation. Tell me, is that a common ingredient in the… *perfumes* favored by those who frequent the study? Or perhaps, are you suggesting the oil's composition is more… *cul*…” Petrova asked, her eyes narrowed with suspicion.

Thorne, his expression carefully neutral, responded, “Madam Petrova, the composition of the oil is, indeed, of some interest. But before we explore that further, let us consider the presence of... *blood*. I believe we have all, perhaps, overlooked a rather crucial detail. *Who* among us knew of Lord Alistair's... *allergy* to almonds?”

Davies, his voice a low rumble, retorted, “Mr. Thorne, your questions are becoming... *unsettling*. I find your constant probing of Lord Alistair's… *afflictions* quite distasteful. Perhaps you should focus on the more immediate concerns, such as the *manner* of his passing, rather than delving into... *senseless* details.”

“Mr. Davies, are you suggesting that Lord Alistair's allergy was a *secret*? A secret perhaps known only to those privy to his… *private* life? Or, perhaps, a secret known only to those who… *benefited* from his demise?” Petrova posed, her voice a low whisper.

Dubois, his gaze unwavering, turned to Thorne. “Mr. Thorne, you seem to have a particular interest in the oil. Could you describe its scent, if you will? Does it, perhaps, remind you of a specific substance, perhaps something that might be found in a study, or even in a kitchen?”

Eleanor, back in the Guest Bedroom, tucks the parchment into the pouch, replaces it in the secret compartment, and smooths the floorboard back into place, securing the confession.

Davies, his voice a low rumble, stated, “Madam Petrova, Lord Alistair's secrets are now... *irrelevant*. His death is the matter at hand. I suggest we all focus our attention on the *reality* of this situation, before the Inspector arrives.”

Thorne, his voice carefully measured, replied, “Mr. Dubois, the scent of the oil is quite distinct. As I mentioned, linseed oil and a hint of almonds, which, as you rightly point out, *could* be found in both a study and a kitchen. However, the more pertinent question, I believe, is not *where* it might be found, but *why* it's there. And, specifically, if it relates to Lord Alistair's sudden demise.”

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, opens the wardrobe, looking for a bag.

TUFE COMIENZA AQUI
“Revenge, Mr. Thorne? Or perhaps simply… *business*? After all, sometimes the most… *valuable* transactions involve a certain… *exchange* of assets. And Lord Alistair, let's not forget, possessed…” Petrova whispered, her eyes gleaming.

Dubois, his gaze fixed on the dusting cloth stained with oil and a faint smear of blood.

Davies, his hand resting on the cold marble of the fireplace mantel, his gaze sweeping across the room, gathering his thoughts.

Petrova, in the Study, traces the edge of the bloodstain with a gloved finger, brings it to her nose, and sniffs.

Dubois, his voice taking on a hint of a challenge, looked at Mr. Davies. “Mr. Davies, you appear to be taking a particular interest in the fireplace. May I ask if you noticed anything unusual about its operation this evening? Did you, perhaps, see anyone near the fireplace, perhaps attending to it, before Lord Alistair was discovered?”

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, pulls down the worn leather satchel from the shelf, opens it, and examines the interior, assessing its suitability.

“Mr. Dubois, you are becoming *intrusive*. My attention is focused on the *facts* of this dreadful situation, not on idle speculation about the fireplace. I will not be answering any more questions until the Inspector arrives, and I suggest you cease your attempts to *interrogate* me further,” Davies retorted, his voice a low growl.

Dubois, his gaze unwavering, knelt and carefully examined the muddy footprints, extracting a mud sample with his handkerchief, meticulously gathering evidence.

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, places the velvet pouch into the satchel, tucks it into the lining, closes the satchel, secures the clasp, and quickly scans the room, trying to assess how much time she has before someone might find it.

Petrova, in the Study, pivots towards the hidden passage, takes a step, and gently brushes against the bookshelf's edge, carefully assessing the shadows and the scent of oil.

Thorne, his voice a low murmur, addressing himself, spoke, “The passage of time...it is a relentless judge, is it not? Tick...tock...tick...tock...”

Petrova, her voice a low whisper, uttered, “Intriguing… and perhaps… *revealing*.”

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, walks towards the window, wanting to escape.

Thorne, addressing Dubois, stated, “The fire is certainly roaring tonight, isn't it? Such a stark contrast to the… *chill* in the air, both inside and out. I do hope someone remembered to inform the staff about keeping the flames contained; a fire in such a grand old house would be a catastrophe.”

Davies, his voice a low, steady rumble, added, “The hour is late. Let us all await the Inspector's arrival in *silence*.”

Dubois, his voice firm, turned to Davies. “Mr. Thorne, you mentioned almonds and a possible connection to the kitchen. Considering the oily footprint leading from the kitchen towards this room, and the bloodied handprint on the Study doorframe, I believe it prudent to secure the kitchen immediately. Mr. Davies, I must insist that you instruct the staff to seal the kitchen off. No one is to enter or leave until the official investigation commences, and the Inspector arrives. I would suggest that any kitchen staff remain…”

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, cautiously pushes the window open a crack, assessing the wind and the possibility of escape.

Davies, his voice a low, unwavering growl, stated, “The kitchen will remain *unsecured*. I will handle the instructions to the staff, and any attempt to *restrict* their movements will be… *counterproductive* to the investigation. The Inspector will decide, and until he arrives, *this house* will remain under my command.”

Thorne, his voice tinged with a hint of suspicion, added, “Mr. Dubois, your insistence on securing the kitchen is... *intriguing*. I am certain the staff are devastated by Lord Alistair's passing, and the thought of them being unfairly accused is quite… *unsettling*. But perhaps, perhaps *someone* within this house is keen on controlling the narrative. I would hate to see the innocent... *punished*.”

Dubois, his gaze unwavering, turned to Thorne. “Mr. Thorne, you seem concerned about the potential innocence of the staff and the 'narrative'. Given that you have so readily identified the scent of the oil as linseed, and, considering Lord Alistair's known allergy, could you perhaps enlighten us as to your knowledge of the contents of Lord Alistair's Study, or indeed, his Kitchen? Does either room hold any significance to you, and, if so, why?”

Petrova, in the Study, opens her handbag and retrieves a silver compact.

Thorne, his voice laced with mock innocence, replied, “Mr. Dubois, are you suggesting *I* possess knowledge that might... *incriminate* me? How very… *preposterous*. While I am Lord Alistair's physician, my duties are solely medical. My familiarity with his, or indeed, the *kitchen's* contents, stems from no nefarious intent, but rather, a long-standing professional relationship. However, now that you mention it, I do believe there may be some almond oil stored away…”

Eleanor, in the Guest Bedroom, closes and latches the window, protecting herself from the storm.

Dubois, his voice calm but firm, addressed Davies. “Mr. Davies, is it common practice for the staff to use linseed oil in the vicinity of the fireplace, or perhaps in any rooms frequented by Lord Alistair, who, as we know, suffered from a severe nut allergy? Your adamant refusal to secure the kitchen, coupled with your insistence on controlling the narrative, raises further questions in my mind. Perhaps you could elaborate on your reasons for this resistance. Your reticence suggests that you might be concealing information that could…”
