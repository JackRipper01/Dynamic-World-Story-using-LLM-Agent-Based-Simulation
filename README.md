# Dynamic World Story using LLM Agent-Based Simulation

## âœ¨ Crafting Emergent Worlds with AI Agents

This project explores a novel **multi-agent simulation system** that leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to generate dynamic, emergent narratives. A unique "Director" agent subtly guides the evolving story by altering the environment and situations of agents, fostering a rich flow of perception, reaction, and plot developments without direct intervention.

*Showcases deep expertise in LLMs, Agent-Based Modeling, and advanced AI applications.*

## Key Technical Achievements & Features

**Core Capabilities:**
*   **LLM-Powered Agent Architecture:** Designed and implemented intelligent agents whose internal states, decision-making, and interactions are dynamically driven by integrated Large Language Models, enabling complex and adaptable behaviors.
*   **Agent-Based Simulation Framework:** Built a robust simulation environment capable of managing multiple concurrent agents, their shared world state, and the progression of time, providing the core for complex interactive scenarios.
*   **Emergent Story Generation:** Explored and implemented principles of emergent storytelling, observing how complex narratives unfold organically from simple agent rules and LLM-driven interactions, rather than static plots.
*   **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** Utilized sophisticated prompt engineering techniques to define agent personalities, manage context, and elicit coherent and creative responses from the LLMs, crucial for consistent narrative flow.

## Getting Started

1. Configure your LLM API keys in [`src_GM/config.py`](src_GM/config.py)
2. Choose a story configuration from [`initial configs/`](initial%20configs/) or create your own
3. Run the simulation: `python src_GM/main.py`
4. Watch as AI agents interact and create emergent narratives!
