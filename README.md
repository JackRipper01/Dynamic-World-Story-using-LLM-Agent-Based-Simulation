# Dynamic World Story using LLM Agent Based Simulation

This repository explores the design and observation of a multi-agent simulation system based on Large Language Models (LLMs). The system features a "Director" that influences the emergent narrative by altering the environment or situation of the agents, rather than directly intervening in their internal states or actions. This approach allows for the study of the resulting flow of perception, reaction, and plot development.

**Key Features:**
- **LLM-Based Agents:** Utilizes LLMs to simulate agent behavior and interactions.
- **Environmental Manipulation:** The Director modifies the environment to guide the narrative.
- **Emergent Storytelling:** Observes how the narrative unfolds dynamically based on agent interactions and environmental changes.

**Goals:**
- Investigate the dynamics of narrative emergence in a multi-agent system.
